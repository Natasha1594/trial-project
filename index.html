            <h2>Here are things to note before becoming a developer:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> 1.To never stop learning, be prepared for this, there are two pieces. 
                    Second, technology continually evolves. Libraries will go from Release Candidate to Version 4 over the course of about a year (I'm looking at you, Angular!). 
                A   side from that, priorities shift, too. To stay sharp, you need to be eager and capable of self-education and power through documentation and tutorials.</li>
                <li>2. Learning to be social.
                    You have no urge to end up in a silo. Socializing with colleagues is extremely beneficial to your wellbeing and your employability. 
                    Reach out to community members, go every now and then to have a coffee/beer with them. 
                    Neither do you have to stick to only developers, find groups of entrepreneurs, consultants, or even top gamers at the table!</li>
                <li>3. Don't compare yourself to others.
                    Learn to understand that someone better/more experienced than you will always be there and that you will always be farther ahead than any others.
                    Most professional developers are happy to offer positive code reviews and tips, with a few exceptions. 
                    We were all less mature than we are now, and only by learning from others did we get here.</li>
                <li>4. Look out for issues around mental health.
                    The developer community is experiencing a growing epidemic of anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses. 
                    Obviously, seek professional support if you feel you are experiencing all of this.
                    It is taxing to spend long hours gazing at a phone, maxing out your brain day after day. 
                    You can get caught up in the spiral of mind if you don't have a healthy work/life balance.</li>
